## THE EDITORIAL OF DANIEL HARTWELL

### What about courage? What about discipline? What if we actually tried?

*By Daniel Hartwell*

At the start of this cycle, after another quarter of speeches and delays, we heard the same line from policymakers and executives alike: "Yes, this reform is necessary, but we cannot do it right now."

The pattern is familiar. Everyone agrees productivity must rise, permitting must be faster, hiring must be easier, investment must be clearer. Then comes the hesitation. Strategy turns into commentary. Urgency becomes process.

Meanwhile, competitors move. They ship faster, automate earlier, and defend margins with fewer excuses. We celebrate tiny improvements while structural gaps widen.

This is not a mystery of economics. It is a failure of will.

The companies that still win in uncertain markets do three simple things: they cut low-return projects, keep pricing power, and make decisions before consensus feels comfortable.

Leadership in 2026 does not require perfect forecasts. It requires choosing a direction and accepting the cost of execution.
